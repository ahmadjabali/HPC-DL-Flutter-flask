## Introduction

Parkinson Disease (PD): is the degenerative illness of the brain that affects patients’ ability to perform a well-learned motor task such as walking, body balancing as well as writing appropriately (Morris and Lansek, 1996). Unfortunately, PD affects a significant portion of the global population. This disease affects about 1% of individuals over the age of 55.
Parkinson's Disease Deaths in Saudi Arabia reached 0.58% of total deaths


## Problem
Parkinson's disease is notoriously difficult to accurately diagnose, with misdiagnosis rates as high as 25% of cases. The strategies outlined in this work aim to effectively and accurately classify healthy individuals from affected ones

## Data Preparation
- Renaming variables for simpler observing.
- Reordering columns.
- Oversampling 
- Dropping columns correlated with the target column


## Model training and testing
**Training:**
- Data splitting
- Binary classification sequential deep learning model consist of four dense layers 
- “Adam” Optimizer was considered 
- The model trained on 100 epochs 

**Testing:**
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 score

## Show your model
**App development:**
- Flask for backend 
- Flutter for frontend 

## Results
**F1 Score :** 90% 
**Accuracy :** 88% 
**Precision :** 95% 
**Recall :** 86% 

## Challenges

- Difficulty in communication and arranging for meetings
- Using Deep learning for first time 
- Deploy the model and connect the model with Flutter framework to build Android,     ios, desktop and web application by using Flask as backend
